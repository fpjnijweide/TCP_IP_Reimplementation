### README

Run framework/MyProtocol.java's main method to start.

Type "DISCOVERY" (and press return) to enable medium access control and routing on a node (it is buggy, so we leave it disabled by default).
Type "DISCOVERYNOW" to skip the initial 8-12 second waiting phase.
Otherwise, type any message you want to transmit to neighbor nodes.
